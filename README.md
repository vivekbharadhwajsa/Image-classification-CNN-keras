# Image-classification-CNN-keras
This project deals with classifying classes ('airplane', 'car' and 'bird') in the CIFAR10 dataset using CNNs

The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 60000 images belonging to 10 different classes ('airplane', 'cat', 'bird', 'car', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship' and 'truck')

image size = 32*32

Convolutional Neural Network is built using Keras and trained in order to detect if the image in the dataset belong to these 3 classes 

Acheived a CNN train accuracy of 88 % when trained
